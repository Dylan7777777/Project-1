## Data Cleanup
The data set has moved from over 600,000 in its raw format to a little over 6000 after eliminating dropping rows with empty cells and numerous duplicates. 
Data cleanup was fairly straight forward except for the zip code which was imported as a float
In some cases the zip code was 3 digits or 4 digits and had to be converted to a 5 character string
